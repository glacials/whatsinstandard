# What's in Standard?
*[What's in Standard?][0]* is a simple reference page made to help new (or not new) Magic: The Gathering players easily
check which sets are currently in [Standard][1], see when the next rotation is going to happen, and understand how
rotations work.

## Development

### Images
We display MTG set symbols for released sets. Where possible these are SVGs, but often the most recent set symbol isn't
yet available in SVG. In this situation we use the "large" resolution image from Gatherer ([example][3]). Set symbols
vary in width, so we standardize on a height of 21px and let the widths behave how they want.

### Running it locally
```bash
git clone git@github.com:glacials/whatsinstandard
cd whatsinstandard

# OS X
open index.html

# Linux
xdg-open index.html
```

You shouldn't need to serve the files from any sort of web server. Opening `index.html` in a browser should work just
fine.

#### Tests
The API has a few tests. You can run them with

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

To autorun them whenever test files update, use

```bash
npm run autotest
```

### API
We've got an API. It's super slim and the output is written by hand but it works like a charm.

#### [/api/3/sets.json][5]

This is the only API call we have. It returns a JSON array of sets which looks something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Dragons of Tarkir",
    "block": "Khans of Tarkir",
    "code": "DTK",
    "symbol": "http://whatsinstandard.com/img/dtk.svg",
    "enter_date": "2015-03-27T00:00:00.000Z",
    "exit_date": null,
    "rough_exit_date": "late 2016"
  },
  ...
]
```

The array is guaranteed to contain all sets currently in Standard and no other sets (unlike the website, which shows a
few upcoming sets grayed out).

For API details see [the API readme][6].
