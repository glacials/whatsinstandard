## API
Hey, welcome to this super awesome API. It has one endpoint! Here is an example request:

```sh
curl whatsinstandard.com/api/v6/standard.json
```

This will return something like:

```json
{
  "deprecated": false,
  "sets": [
    {
      "name": "Kaladesh",
      "codename": "Lock",
      "code": "KLD",
      "symbol": {
        "common": "http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=symbol&size=large&rarity=C&set=KLD",
        "uncommon": "http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=symbol&size=large&rarity=U&set=KLD",
        "rare": "http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=symbol&size=large&rarity=R&set=KLD",
        "mythicRare": "http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=symbol&size=large&rarity=M&set=KLD"
      },
      "enterDate": {
        "exact": "2016-09-30T00:00:00.000"
      },
      "exitDate": {
        "exact": "2018-10-05T00:00:00.000",
        "rough": "Q4 2018"
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
  "bans": [
    {
      "cardName": "Rampaging Ferocidon",
      "cardImageUrl": "https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/en/xln/154.jpg?1527429722",
      "setCode": "XLN",
      "reason": "Banned for being too effective a shutdown against counters to aggressive red (filling the board with small creatures and gaining life).",
      "announcementUrl": "https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-15-2018-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2018-01-15"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

But you can just [visit it yourself][1] to see everything. You'll get some JSON containing an array of Magic sets and
banned cards.

### Documentation
The API specification is written in JSON Schema, which is a way of saying programmatically what the structure of the API
is. You can view the user-friendly documentation generated by the schema using this link:

#### [View documentation][2]

You can also view or download the [raw JSON Schema][3] to help you validate your code or generate structures in your
language of choice automatically.

### Notes
The `sets` array contains a superset of all sets in Standard -- it may contain some sets that have dropped and some sets
that have not yet released. It is your responsibility to filter these sets out by comparing each set's `enter_date` and
`exit_date` to the current date.

Here's a JavaScript function that does just that:
```javascript
const standardSets = callback => {
  fetch('https://whatsinstandard.com/api/v6/standard.json').then(response => response.json().then(body => {
    callback(body.sets.filter(set => {
      return ((Date.parse(set.enterDate.exact) || Infinity) <= Date.now())
          && ((Date.parse(set.exitDate.exact)  || Infinity) >  Date.now())
    }))
  }))
}
```

The bans array is in order of ban, from oldest ban to newest. Again, it contains a superset of all bans in Standard --
it may contain some bans that belong to sets that have dropped. Filter these bans out by correlating each ban's
`setCode` to a `code` from a set included in the `sets` array, filtered to exclude non-Standard sets:
```javascript
const bannedCards = callback => {
  fetch('https://whatsinstandard.com/api/v6/standard.json').then(response => response.json().then(body => {
    callback(body.bans.filter(ban => {
      return body.sets.filter(set => {
        return ((Date.parse(set.enterDate.exact) || Infinity) <= Date.now())
            && ((Date.parse(set.exitDate.exact)  || Infinity) >  Date.now())
      }).map(set => set.code).includes(ban.setCode)
    }))
  }))
}
```

### Automatic deprecation alerts
When using the API, you should always check the root object's boolean field `deprecated`, which will flip on if that API
version becomes deprecated. Configure your program to notify you if this field is ever `true` so you aren't caught off
guard if the version you use is deprecated then eventually killed.

API v1 through v4 are past deprecation and no longer available.

#### Changelog

##### Version 6
* All properties that used `snake_case` now use `camelCase`.
* `enterDate`, `roughEnterDate`, `exitDate`, and `roughExitDate` have been simplified to `enterDate` and `exitDate`,
  each an object with `rough` and `exact` properties.
* `(enter|exit)Date.rough` can now hold either a month or a quarter.
* `code` can now be null.
* `name` can now be null.
* Added `codename` property.
* Set symbols are once again available in the API.
* The `block` property has been removed.

##### Version 5
* The root element in the response is now an object, not an array. The root object's `sets` field is the array.
* Added a new `deprecated` field to the root object. This field will be `false` until v6 of the API is introduced, which
  will flip it to `true`.
* The API base path has changed from `whatsinstandard.com/api/\d` to `whatsinstandard.com/api/v\d` to be more consistent
  with the rest of the internet.
* Like upcoming sets in v4, sets that have rotated out of Standard can now be included in the sets array. There is no
  guarantee about the number of these sets included (though it will generally be single-digit). You should filter on
  `enter_date` and `exit_date` if you care only about the sets currently in Standard.
* `enter_date` can now be null to allow for upcoming sets whose release dates are not known.
* `block` can now be null to allow for new [blockless sets][2].
###### Midversion nonbreaking changes
* **2018-04-28:** `enter_date` and `exit_date` no longer include timezone (see [#75][3]). The dates are still ISO 8601
  compatible and are now intended to be parsed in the local timezone.
* **2019-02-28:** Documentation for `code` now correctly states it matches `/[A-Z0-9]{3}/`. It previously incorrectly
  stated that it matched `/[A-Z]{3}/`. No behavior has changed, only documentation.
* **2019-02-28:** Banned cards are now included in API.

##### Version 4
* Upcoming sets are once again included in the sets array. To use only released sets or only unreleased sets, filter on
  `enter_date`.
* `block` can no longer be `null`, as no more core sets will enter Standard.
* The `symbol` field has been removed to decrease maintenance work. If you'd like still like to fetch set images, you
  can instead use the `code` field to construct an image URL like
  `http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=symbol&set=<code>&size=large&rarity=C`.
* `rough_exit_date` regex has changed from `/(early\/mid|late) 20\d\d/` to `/Q\d 20\d\d/` for simplicity.

##### Version 3
Valid `rough_exit_date` regex has changed from `/(early|late) 20\d\d/` to `/(early\/mid|late) 20\d\d/` to account for
the new Standard rotation style. Old API versions will continue to match their respective regexes, but with potentially
less accuracy. See Wizards's [article on the change][3] for details.

##### Version 2
Upcoming unreleased sets are no longer included in the sets array.

## Contributing
If you're making changes to the API, note that the `api/v*/*.json` files are generated programmatically by
`api/v*/generate.js` scripts. The scripts read the unstable `api/internal.json` file in this directory and output
version-stable JSON.

In other words: `api/internal.json` is the database, `api/v*/generate.js` is the view, and `api/v*/*.json` is the
generated output.

Run
```sh
npm install
```
to regenerate the endpoints.
