If no user is given, the authenticating user is used.A maximum of 100 results will be  returned by this call. Subscribed lists are returned first, followed by owned lists.  This means that if a user subscribes to 90 lists and owns 20 lists, this method returns  90 subscriptions and 10 owned lists.

If your goal is to obtain every list a user owns or subscribes to,  use GET lists / ownerships and/or GET lists / subscriptions instead.
